# Spring Tutorial

This is a basic GraphQL API to teach how to generate java backends.

To build and run the application run `docker compose up --build -d`.

You will then be able to make queries from the GUI at `http://localhost:8080/graphiql?path=/graphql` 
OR via regular GET/POST calls at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

For information on how to set up your environment and tips on development and more spin up the docs by running `mkdocs serve` (WIP).
